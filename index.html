<div class="law" id="law1">
<h2>1st Law: Law of Inertia</h2>
<p>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.</p>
</div>
<div class="law" id="law2">
<h2>2nd Law: F = ma</h2>
<p>The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting upon it and its mass. 
It is expressed by the formula: <strong>F = m * a</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="law" id="law3">
<h2>3rd Law: Action and Reaction</h2>
<p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
